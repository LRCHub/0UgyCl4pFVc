We grew up together
You were the boy next door
We treated each other
Like sister and brother
It was never anything more

We grew up together
And darlin', you know it breaks my heart
'Cause I never knew
How much I loved you
Until we grew apart

You know, I remember once
You asked me for a date
And I turned you down
'Cause I just couldn't think of you that way
Well, I've only got myself to blame
'Cause you never asked me again

We grew up together
And darlin', you know it breaks my heart
'Cause I never knew
How much I loved you
Until we grew apart
